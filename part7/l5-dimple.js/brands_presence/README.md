Here is my critique for the original visualization:

    1) Brandsâ€™ logos are inside the bars. It was better to show company names outside the bars instead.
    2) Values on X axis are in an opposite way from the bars values.
    3) There are confusing bindings between brands and its values, using dotted lines
    4) Using this scale, it is not possible to see that Youtube is much greater than Google value, for example.
    5) Bars sizes for Samsung and Skype are different, although corresponding to the same value.
