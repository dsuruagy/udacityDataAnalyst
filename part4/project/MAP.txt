Map position

The map used was collected from https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/rio-de-janeiro_brazil/ .

I intended to use my brazilian hometown (Recife), but the data was really poor. So I've decided to download the map from a city where I already lived, Rio de Janeiro, that is a very known city outside Brazil.
